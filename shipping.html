    <h2 class="h5 mt-3">1. Dispatch times</h2>
    <p>We aim to offer fast, discreet shipping on all orders.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Next-day delivery</strong> is available on UK orders where cleared payment is received <strong>before 3pm (Monday–Friday)</strong>.</li>
      <li>Orders placed after 3pm, on weekends or on UK bank holidays will normally be dispatched on the next working day.</li>
      <li>In busy periods, dispatch times may be slightly longer, but we will always do our best to keep delays to a minimum.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">2. Delivery methods</h2>
    <p>We typically use tracked and/or signed-for delivery services within the UK. The exact courier or service may vary based on location, order value and operational considerations.</p>
    <p>You will normally receive a confirmation email once your order has been dispatched. Where possible, we may provide a tracking number so you can follow the progress of your delivery.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">3. Packaging</h2>
    <p>All orders are shipped in <strong>discreet packaging</strong> with no external indication of the contents, to protect your privacy.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">4. Delivery times</h2>
    <p>While next-day delivery is available for qualifying orders, all delivery timeframes are estimates and not guarantees. Once an order is handed to the courier, transit times are outside our direct control.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">5. Incorrect address or non-delivery</h2>
    <p>Please ensure your delivery address is complete and accurate at the time of ordering. We are not responsible for delayed or failed deliveries caused by incorrect or incomplete address information.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">6. Delays outside our control</h2>
    <p>We are not liable for delays caused by events outside our reasonable control, such as courier issues, severe weather, strikes, customs delays, or other disruptions. In such cases we will work with you and the courier to resolve the issue where possible.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">7. Lost or damaged parcels</h2>
    <p>If your parcel appears to be lost or arrives damaged, please contact us promptly with your order reference and any relevant details. We may ask for photos of any damage to the packaging and contents to assist with investigation.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">8. Contact</h2>
